        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


        <br><p style="font-family:Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align:center">Hey there! I am Loveleen Kaur, a student of class of 2021 at BCCA.
            BCCA (Base Camp Coding Academy) is a non-profitable private organization dedicated to 
            training high school graduates into Software Developers by the end of its 11-month course. 
            <br><br>To give a little more insight on what BCCA is actually like, 
            I interviewed another student at BCCA: Scott Gregory Bowles. This interview took place on November 19, 2020.
        </p><br><br><br>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>What has been the toughest week?</th>
                <th>What has been the easiest week?</th>
                <th>What is your biggest victory so far?</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"The toughest week was definitely the first Unit project. 
                    I was no where near prepared enough to do all of the work 
                    we had done, and required."</td>
                <td>"The easiest week was this week with HTML and CSS, I understand everything we have been doing 
                    and is quite easy."</td>
                <td>"Getting through the first unit project. I wasn't really the most confident that i was gonna make 
                    it through the week and was expecting to get taken out of the program."</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br><br><br><p>In my perspective, BCCA is a promising opportunity. We are 11 weeks in and I have already
            learned more than I could imagine. I started off not knowing anything about code. Yet, here I am
            learning different languages and making programs. 
            <br><br>Greg leaves us off with his final thoughts:
            "I am enjoying Base Camp a lot. I have made plenty of friends 
            and am enjoying working with everyone here. I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is eligible and wants 
            to become a software developer."
