        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


        <br><p1>Hey there! I am Loveleen Kaur, a student of class of 2021 at BCCA.
            BCCA (Base Camp Coding Academy) is a non-profitable private organization dedicated to 
            training high school graduates into Software Developers by the end of its 11-month course. 
            To give a little more insight on what BCCA is actually like, 
            I interviewed another student at BCCA: Scott Gregory Bowles.</p1><br><br><br>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>What has been the toughest week at BCCA?</th>
                <th>What has been the easiest week at BCCA?</th>
                <th>What is your biggest victory so far at BCCA?</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"The toughest week was definitely the first Unit project. 
                    I was no where near prepared enough to do all of the work 
                    we had done, and required."</td>
                <td>"The easiest week was this week with HTML and CSS, I understand everything we have been doing 
                    and is quite easy."</td>
                <td>"Getting through the first unit project. I wasn't really the most confident that i was gonna make 
                    it through the week and was expecting to get taken out of the program."</td>
            </tr>
        </table>


        







        <!--<div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding:0.1px">
        <h3>QUESTION: What has been the toughest week at BCCA?</h3>
        </div>
        <br><p2>"The toughest week was definitely the first Unit project. 
            I was no where near prepared enough to do all of the work 
            we had done, and required."</p2><br><br>
        <div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding:0.1px">
            <h4>QUESTION: What has been the easiest week at BCCA?</h4>
        </div>
        <br><p3>"The easiest week was this week with HTML and CSS, I understand everything we have been doing 
            and is quite easy."</p3><br><br>
        <div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding:0.1px">
            <h5>QUESTION: What is your biggest victory so far at BCCA?</h5>
        </div>
        <br><p4>"Getting through the first unit project. I wasn't really the most confident that i was gonna make 
            it through the week and was expecting to get taken out of the program."</p4><br><br>--> 
        <br><p5>In my perspective, BCCA is a promising opportunity. We are 11 weeks in and I have already
            learned more than I could imagine. I started off not knowing anything about code. Yet, here I am
            learning different languages and making programs. 
            Greg leaves us off with his final thoughts:
            "I am enjoying Base Camp a lot. I have made plenty of friends 
            and am enjoying working with everyone here. I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is eligible and wants 
            to become a software developer."
